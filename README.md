# Artificial Intelligence project: Implementation of mazes and search methods

### Compilation

There are two ways of compiling this project: **cmake** or directly with **make**.

- *make* contains directives *all* and *run*, to compile and run.
- No arguments must be provided for the execution; 
- Source code is at `src`;
- Include *(.hpp)* files are at `include`;
- Main source file is `src/main.cpp`;
- *cmake* was actually used by the *IDE* we were using *(CLion)*;
- If you receive some error like `sh: 1: ../visualize/vis.gp: not found`, changing the defines at `include/Benchamrk.hpp` should help.

### Notes

This project was developed using Linux, C++ and Gnuplot.

If you are going to run some *Benchmark.cpp* function, you may have to install gnuplot.

Also, take a look at the *main.cpp* header! It contains some additional notes.
